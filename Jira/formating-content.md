# Formatting Jira comments with markdown like syntax

## Jira Tables
In Jira, there is a basic editor, but you can choopse between visual or text editors.

Tables are in the format of:
```
||Header 1||Header2 ||
|Content1| Content2|
|Content 1a| Content2a|
```
This is handy to know so you can use PowerShell to query data and output it in this way to nbe easiluy pasted into a Jira comment field.

## Other useful bits

While not exactly markdown, Jira does support using 
```
(x)
```
for crosses and
```
(/)
```
for ticks. Useful to know.
