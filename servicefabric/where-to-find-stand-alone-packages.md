# Where to find stand alone packages for Service Fabric

When new Service Fabric packages are released they are announced on the [Service Fabric blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azureservicefabric/).

For SDK updates, they recommend to run the Web Platform Installer and for Runtime updates you can get links from the [Service Fabric documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/).

But what if our local dev and test environments are not connected to the Internet?

If you look at the release notes DOCX file that is part of each release \([sample](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azureservicefabric/2017/05/24/release-of-sdk-2-6-210-and-runtime-5-6-210-refresh-for-windows-and-sdk-2-7-and-runtime-5-7-preview/)\), they include links to the direct packages you need to install.
